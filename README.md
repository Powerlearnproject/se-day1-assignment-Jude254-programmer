Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

#Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
Ensures Reliability- Critical applications like healthcare, banking, and transportation depend on well-structured software.
Improves Efficiency- Engineers use best practices to optimize performance and reduce errors.
Supports Scalability- Well-engineered software can handle increasing users and workloads.
Enhances Security- Software engineers implement security measures like encryption and authentication to protect data.




#Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

a) Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)- Brought concepts like,classes & objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, leading to reusable and scalable code.
b) Agile methodology - prioritized flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress from rigid process
c) Mastering machines - software engineers learned how to harness the full potential of computer hardware through optimized programming techniques, operating systems, and efficient software development.


#List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning- identify objectives, purpose and target time for the project
Requirement Analysis - identify the desired output of the software
Design - create the architecture and build the UI and Framework
Coding - Convert the designs into actual codes to run programs
Testing - Test and debug your code
Deployment - release the software to the world for use
Maintainance - Keep track of your program and update to improve functionality


#Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

By approach Waterfall is sequential while Agile is iterative
By flexibility Waterfall is rigid while Agile is adaptable to changes
Considering Customer feedback in waterfall feedback comes after the final product while Agile has regular feedback at each sprint


#Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer 
- Develops applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
- Mantains code, fixes bugs, and optimizes performance.
Quality Assurance Engineer
- Tests softwares for errors ensuring it meets user requirements before deployment
Project Manager
- Plans of the project, enhances co-ordinations and ensures project is completed on time and meets business requirements
  

#Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Example of IDE is Vs Code of which provide tools like code completion, debugging, and version control to streamline development.
Example of VCS is Git which tracks and save changes to your code


#What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

High rate in Change of Technology- Keep learning new tools and frameworks through courses, blogs, and hands-on practice.
Failure to meet project deadlines- Use Agile and Scrum methodologies to break down work into smaller, manageable tasks.
Bug Fixing & Debugging- Follow best coding practices, write test cases, and conduct code reviews to reduce errors early.


#Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work as expected.
Integration Testing: Ensures different modules of the software interact correctly.
System Testing: Examines the software as a whole to check its functionality.
Acceptance Testing: Validates whether the software meets business and user requirements before final deployment.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


#Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the ability to  craft clear and precise instructions (promts) for AI models to generate accurate and relevant outputs.


#Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt - Programming meaning
Improved prompt - Explain to me what is computer programming assumming I'm a beginner capturing key features



Vague Prompt- "Programming meaning."
Improved Prompt- "Explain to me about computer programming and it's key features
